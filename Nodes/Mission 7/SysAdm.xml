Report from Kellis BioTech, Security Chief Logan Derrick:

Recently we discovered that one of our security protocols for medical servicies (Special port Num. 104) has a critical vulnerability that allows you to break that port, using overflow of self-cyciling comands.

Your email adress was assigned as a Security Administrator of a California Medical Facility, and therefore, this security problem involves you as well.

You can analyze port-breaker tool and find a way to resolve the problem. You can download a prototype here: 48.189.248.31
