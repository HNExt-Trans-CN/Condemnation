  <post user="Abigail Nelson">Yep, I gotta rest a bit, haven't slept for 3 days already</post>
  <post user="Anthony Walker (MOD)">Well, I still have to figure out that security problem</post>
  <post user="Vanessa Lewis">Ironic that I can handle professional medical equipment but can't get along with simple PCs</post>

  <post user="Anthony Walker (MOD)">Ah, annoying thing, tech guys from one medical company think our Cyber Security is weak because recently hacker groups assaulted a few medical servers</post>
  <post user="Abigail Nelson">Sounds like a big problem</post>
  <post user="Anthony Walker (MOD)">Maybe, so I am working on finding a way to eliminate that vulnerability</post>
  <post user="Vanessa Lewis">Best of luck!</post>
