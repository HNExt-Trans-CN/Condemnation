<note>Vortex

He is a new potential member, weak for now, but has an interesting ability to cover his logs automatically and we can't trace him, and so our potential enemies

I baited him with the NetMap fixer that I made just for him
without second part of it, NetMap is still inoperable 

It is located on one of my archives (58.141.177.25)
If anyone from the group is against letting him in, simply delete fixer file from linked machine, you all know how to pass</note>
