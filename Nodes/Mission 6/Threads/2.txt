Definitely not you kid:
1) You have no security system whatsoever, I can gain access through 1 open port;
2) You got only ssh cracker;
3) You are stupid kid named Jeffry Babinski, 12 yo, worst grades, a disappointment to your parents.
Do I have to continue if I found all that information in 1 minute?
