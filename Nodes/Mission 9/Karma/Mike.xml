//[09:21]/Dalvin/How?)//
//[09:22]/Mike/He is using his jmail for passwords restoring and it is so dumb to name that mail account "LEAK_ADMIN". Like, come on man, it is just so stupid, and then they blame me for different fuck ups, sheesh//
//[09:23]/Dalvin/jmail is joojle.jmail.com[@Hacknet_OS_Scan:62.35.253.222], right?//
//[09:23]/Mike/Yeah. And on top of all that, he LITERALLY sets his password to be a reversed username!//
//[09:23]/Mike/Like, people could simply "lockpick" his email account and just enter "admin+NewPassword" into database's login and that't it!//
//[09:24]/Dalvin/I think you shouldn't say that anywhere, even here//
//[09:24]/Mike/Big Bro listening and all that? I don't know, I have a nice security but you right, who knows...//</file>
