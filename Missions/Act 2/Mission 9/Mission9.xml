    <subject>Operation Venomous Snake</subject>
    <body>THIS E-MAIL IS TRANSMITTING FROM THE EXTERNAL INBOX:
	
This operation requires a skill to infiltrate inside of a well-organized security system that use encryption.
	

Jenkins - manage all tools we may need, including DECSuite, client provided it on a DECSuite Deploy Server

Slayer - make sure that nobody will interfere in our operation

Vortex - research and find a way to connect to the most secured units. There will be 5 of them (instructions are on DECSuite Deploy Server)

Deladello - social engineering as usual, find all possible cracks and leaks that medical staff left

Prophet - I need you to help me to create a mass upload of our ransomware

Collect your decryption tool at the attached server
Good luck
	-M


目标:
UPLOAD ransomware to /sys folder of any life support unit you can find (5 in total)</body>
