    <body>I made it to the client's PC

I can try to manipulate his data to prevent that terrorist attack
But in that case NightHawks won't get any attention, Omicron won't be interested

Isn't it a disgusting thought, that I even consider to justify murder of nearly 60 people?...

I need help from Clara
She can analyze netcfgx.dll of that guy and find evidence of a terrorist attack preparation
And now I know for sure that Omicron is alive and ready to make another assault. Clara should know about that

I need to send her Malber's netcfgx.dll and a copy of HaHaTrap.bat for analysis
I can simply place them in her workstation's /home folder

Unless I'll finish the job...

That would help me to confront Omicron directly
But at what cost?...</body>
