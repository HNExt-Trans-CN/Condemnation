    <body>What have I done?
	
Javis was one of my best operatives

He is a hero that helped people of San-Francisco to enjoy safer digital space
And in the end I am making his life even worse

Now he will live in society's contempt like some fucking junkie that he never was
Because of me...

It wasn't my fault...
It's just circumstances that made me do it

But I never stop thinking that there was another way, that I didn't think of or didn't find

At least I can proceed
I wish there would be no more sacrifices I have to make to achieve my goal

I am just feeling lost,
There is a reason I became a cop:
I want to help people, not to hurt them

And something inside me is just eating away at me for what I've done just now

I must redeem this sacrifice and prove to myself that it wasn't for nothing
I can use this new group of hackers to finally have some progress with my search
They need me, and I must use it to find Omicron
This is what I need...

They gave me access
I have to play my cards right...</body>
