    <body>It had to be done...

They won't believe me otherwise
I had to do it...

Now I remember all those moments of woking undercover
You sacrifice something to achieve justice in the end

But I can't see any justice in my actions that I did just now...

I sacrificed one of my best operatives who done nothing wrong
Just to achieve vengeance
What I am turning into? ...

They will let me in now
But I paid a price: a good person's life

Was it really worth it?
Wasn't there another way?

These questions will be in my head for a long time
But I have to continue my vengence

After I get to Omicron
Only then I can find peace in my soul...

Now, I have to join NightHawks 
And put on my pokerface...</body>
