    <body>What have I done?
	
This guy was just a good policeman doing his job: catching scumbags like this one

And now me and some low-life arms dealer destroyed his career, his life
Same thing happened to me, and I know how it feels...

This man is either going to revenge, or give up and die in society's contempt

It wasn't my fault...
It's just circumstances that made me do it

But I never stop thinking that there was another way, that I didn't think of or didn't find

At least I can proceed
I wish there would be no more sacrifices I have to make to achieve my goal

I am just feeling lost,
There is a reason I became a cop:
I want to help people, not to hurt them

And something inside me is just eating away at me for what I've done just now

I must redeem this sacrifice and prove to myself that it wasn't for nothing
I can use this new group of hackers to finally have some progress with my search
They need me, and I must use it to find Omicron
This is what I need...

They gave me access
I have to play my cards right...</body>
