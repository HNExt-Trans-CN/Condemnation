    <body>It worked

It was a pure gamble
But worked

There could be a possibility that NightHawks will think of me as a traitor
But if I act properly, I may integrate

They won't find my logs, because they can't see them
And this guy was conducting some experiments on how police reacts to netcfgx.dll uploads
This should work as my alibi

Not bad results so far:
I closed the case of Repulse
One of mine best operetives is unharmed
I got access to the group (Still may be a trap)

But what do I have to loose?

Thoughts about saving a person who wasn't just my subordinate, but my friend
Are motivating more than anything else

Time to put my mask on
It is showtime...</body>
