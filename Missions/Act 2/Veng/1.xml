    <body>Shit, fuck, FUUUCK

That cunt made Clara outlaw as well!

For fuck sake, I am so tired of this bullshit with sacrificing
Why me? Why the FUCK IT SHOULD BE ME???

What did I wrong in my entire life to deserve this, huh?

I will remember that fucking day it all began
Downloading a shitty drug evidence
It would be fucking better if I didn't touch it at all!

I have nothing to lose now
That motherfucker will die in agony and burn in hell
I will make sure of it...

I have his location
I just need to decipher it properly

NightHawks will help
I gave them tools
Now they need to pay me back</body>
