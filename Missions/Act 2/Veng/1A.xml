    <body>Shit, fuck, FUUUCK

That cunt made Clara outlaw as well!

For fuck sake, I am so tired of this bullshit with sacrificing
Why me? Why the FUCK IT SHOULD BE ME???

What did I wrong in my entire life to deserve this, huh?

I remember that fucking day it all began
Downloading a shitty drug evidence
It would be fucking better if I didn't touch it at all!

I have nothing to lose now
That motherfucker will die in agony and burn in hell
I will make sure of it...

I have his location
I just need to decipher it properly

NightHawks blocked me from the chat
But I can still connect to the Hub
I need to delete runtime.dll from /sys folder
That way I can reset all restrictions on their server</body>
