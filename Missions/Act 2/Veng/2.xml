    <body>Got it!
Finally got it!

That location file is a key to finally kill that motherfucker!
Slayer has connections
And once we will get all details
Then I can kill Omicron

I need to make sure it will be bloody as possible
Fucker must suffer...

NightHawks should help
They are power drunk
And easily manipulated now
I have to use it in my advantage

Should go back to the IRC...</body>
