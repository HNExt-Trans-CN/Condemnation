    <body>Fuck, fuck, fuck
I lost him!

At least I saved Calra
Maybe that is even more important

But I can lose Omicron as well
I need help

I really hope that Clara will be grateful for my actions
And will help me too
I just saved her after all...

We need to destroy Omicron somehow
Maybe he left some tracks on Clara's network

I should go to our IRC</body>
