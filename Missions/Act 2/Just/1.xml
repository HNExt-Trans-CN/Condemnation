    <body>Fuck, fuck, fuck
I lost him!

Yeah, I saved Clara 
But what the fuck is the point of all this then?

I chased Omicron 
Just to lose him right in the end?
That's not fair...

I really hope that Clara will be grateful for my actions
And will help me too
I just saved her ass after all...

We need to destroy Omicron somehow
Maybe he left some tracks on Clara's network

I need to reset her channel if I want to contact her through it
Just have to delete active.log in /IRC folder
That will attract her attention
And activate the channel</body>
