    <body>I managed to find an entry point into their systems

My map is now restored, but...
What to do next?

Now if I think of it, I am still not capable of finding Omicron alone

I need to gain trust from that group, NightHawks
So I can use their connections and abilities to find a solid lead on Omicron
I must integrate

But how?

I still can complete the job and ruin a life of an innocent man
Or I have to do something else...

I could try to make NightHawks to notice me directly
But only if their agent that is supervising me right now will fuck up

I must find out how to get him out of my way
So it would look like if he made a mistake

I remember that on one of the MemDumps he mentioned cops and experiments on their response...
But to make this work I have to find his PC, not proxy, archive or gateway
The only thing I can think of is to try to find his tracks on servers where he operated somehow lately...

What should I do?
