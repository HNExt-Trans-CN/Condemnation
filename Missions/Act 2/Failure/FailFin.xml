    <body>This is it

Finally I can get to him and extract all I need to find him

Though I lost everything I've got
Only one thing is left
Is to kill that motherfucker...

For Clara
For justice
For myself...

That OSequencer.exe is key to find his true battlestation
And it will redirect me to it
I just have to get in before he reacts

GOAL:
ACTIVATE OSequencer.exe and extract netcfgx.dll of Omicron's PC</body>
