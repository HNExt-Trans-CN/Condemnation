The administration provided us with limited access to the Medical Archive, so we could check the logs, and that's all we need.

We need to find out who is responsible for that attack and get his netcfgx.dll. It should be extracted from his homestation, not gateway or proxy, that won't help us to locate him.

Dig deeper Captain, we will help you along the way!
