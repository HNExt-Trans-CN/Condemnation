Great to know you are eager to finish this matter, Captain!

Me and Bloyd analyzed that netcfgx.dll of Daedra's homestation. Remember they mentioned an IRC and some dropfile server? Well, we found them.

Bloyd got into filedrop server and working on getting to the client, that ordered this attack. He got a Med File of someone named Olivia Brooks, so that means it was confidentiality-break type of contract.

And you have to get inside their IRC server and find some way to get to the homestation of Repulse, get his netcfgx.dll and upload to the Asset server. Meantime, I will investigate about that Dynamic mail server, we haven't got a security certificate from them, meaning that they are not trustworthy service.

After this case, we can start a conference. Good luck to you Captain
