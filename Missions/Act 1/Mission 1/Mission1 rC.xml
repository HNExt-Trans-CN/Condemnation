  <posting title="Data Theft">
Macrosoft has (well, technically HAD) a new security patch, that fixes a vulnerability, that allowed remote access through calculator proccess.

We need to recover it from a hacker and along the way get his internal file.

I knew you would pick up that mission. Me and Javis will cover the rest two.

That sneaky worm infiltrated into the Macrosoft workstation. It is supposed to be well protected, so my guess, he used some social engineering.

Macrosoft provided to us the access, I am linking it here. Find hacker's tracks, research his setup adn recover the patch. Don't forget to place it back to the home/ folder of the Macrosoft workstation.

Oh, and of course, get his pesonal PC's netcfgx.dll from /sys folder, so we could analize his activity and pack him up.

Good luck!

PRO TIP:
Use LOGS to find tracks of criminal's computer systems

GOALS:
1)LOCATE Calculator_Patch.rar on one of the hacker's computers and UPLOAD it to the /home folder of the Macrosoft Workstation
2)UPLOAD hacker's personal computer's netcfgx.dll file to the ASSET server's upload dropbox
