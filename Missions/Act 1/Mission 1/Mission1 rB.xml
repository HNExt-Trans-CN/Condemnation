Prime suspect is a propagandist of communism and using very aggressive strategies.

We have to do something before young maximalists will react to it.

I knew you would pick up that mission. Me and Javis will cover the rest two.

This guy attacked news server and changed frontline to his absurd political propaganda.

We have to track an IP of his PC and pack him up. I will link a frontend server, but most probably you have to poke around and reveal mainframe to find some tracks of that guy.

As for access, that bastard changed Admin Passwords on entire infrastructre, wich means we have a green light on using crack tools.

Find his IP and crack him up, then get his netcfgx.dll from sys/ and upload to the Asset server's upload module. And we will know everything about him.

Good luck on this one!

PRO TIP:
Use LOGS to find tracks of criminal's computer systems

GOALS:
1)GET INSIDE propagandist's Battlestation and UPLOAD his netcfgx.dll to the ASSET server's upload dropbox
