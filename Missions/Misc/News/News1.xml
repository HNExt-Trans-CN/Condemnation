  <posting title="A New Demonstration Of Activists Is Outside Oakland Police Department">
The ongoing story of a Craig Birds, ex-lieutenant of Oakland PD, who is been accused of multiple cases of power abuse, made a 180 degrees turn! Mr. Birds has been released from courthouse this afternoon with all charges lifted.

Activists demand to reopen this case and they are more than certain that judge Mays is another 'pocket change' of Mr. Birds alleged power-abusing system.

Meanwhile, crime activity of all kinds has been increasing in Oakland lately, making it one of the unsafest cities of California State.
