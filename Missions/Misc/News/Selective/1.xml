Allan Turner, recently fired from Sacramento PD, has been found dead in Alaboro motel. Apparently it is a suicide.

This man was a renowed detective of a Sacramento PD, and just recently was fired because of no prove of his qulification or certifiacate of a Police Service Admission, which apparently he masterly faked.

There was also quite a scandle with his personal life, as it appears he infected his wife with HIV and Syphilis after a couple nights with prostitutes.

Sacramento PD could not handle such controversial person and fired Allan which led to a severe depression. Apparently, it is a main motive of a suicide.

Further notice is expected.
