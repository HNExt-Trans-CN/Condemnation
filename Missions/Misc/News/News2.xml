  <posting title="A Son of a Billionaire is Spending Huge Pile of Money on Cocaine and Gets Away With It">
Michael Rosemond, a son of a well-known construction business billionaire Frederick Rosemond, was detained yesterday by a patrolman of LAPD James Grant. Young man was showing off to a different women he was meeting along the street that he is carrying 12 kilograms of a white powder, which later was confirmed to be a high-grade cocaine.

Despite the obvious evidence of a Michael's guilt, he was released this morning with all charges lifted, because it turns out, that lab expertize was faulty and young man was carrying a simple sugar and was portraying it as a narcotic.

Local active-citizen groups are signing a petition to review Rosemond Jr. last activity and his behaviour. They believe that "This golden boy is lost all kind of control and thinks that he is a God himself".

Further notice is expecting.
