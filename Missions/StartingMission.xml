    <body>It's been 2 months since I was put on the Federal Wanted List. 

FBI has raided digital infrastructure of the Emalio drug cartel. My IP was in there, I had admin access all over their secured servers somehow.

I had to move in Sacramento, from motel to motel, and finally I have a flat and laptop that I can use.

I saved Hacknet_OS before escaping and installed it on my new PC. But some parts are still broken.

I've lost everything: my career, my team, my family, my life...

...because of that hacker ... Omicron.

He damaged my system so I can't even defend myself from any kind of hackers...

He didn't destroyed me ... he mutilated me ... fucking sadist.

Oh I will find him and make things right ... but I must remember what I am fighting for. I am now on the other side of the criminal world. 

Should I try to reason with it and achieve revenge any means necessary? Or I still remember what justice is and will remain dignity?

In any way, I am using nickname Vortex now, and looking for a way to get tools and get to the Omicron.

I should start my search on local hacker board, most of the time only kids hang out there, but there always will be bullies from higher league.

Before I proceed with some kind of plan, I have to resotre my hacking potential.

I should start here "34.12.21.38"
