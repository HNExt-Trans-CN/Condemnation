	<AddIRCMessage Author="Vortex" TargetComp="NHHub" Delay="15.0">We need to locate him, and then Slayer will handle him</AddIRCMessage>
	<AddIRCMessage Author="Vortex" TargetComp="NHHub" Delay="20.0">Meanwhile, you can take his network once we are inside his real PC, not some dummy gateway</AddIRCMessage>
	<AddIRCMessage Author="Maverick" TargetComp="NHHub" Delay="25.0">Ok, what about his defence?</AddIRCMessage>
	<AddIRCMessage Author="Vortex" TargetComp="NHHub" Delay="29.0">Most probably there gonna be some security systems</AddIRCMessage>
	<AddIRCMessage Author="Vortex" TargetComp="NHHub" Delay="33.0">That cover his PC from our scanners</AddIRCMessage>
	<AddIRCMessage Author="Vortex" TargetComp="NHHub" Delay="37.0">But then he must use some kind of Sequencer to operate in stealth</AddIRCMessage>
	<AddIRCMessage Author="Maverick" TargetComp="NHHub" Delay="41.0">So what? Where we can find it?</AddIRCMessage>
	<AddIRCMessage Author="Vortex" TargetComp="NHHub" Delay="45.0">I really doubt that he will leave his real address in that file and it is most definitely a trap</AddIRCMessage>
	<AddIRCMessage Author="Vortex" TargetComp="NHHub" Delay="50.0">But when it is active, we can scout a part of his network that is connected to his PC somehow, like through Sequencer as I said</AddIRCMessage>
	<AddIRCMessage Author="Maverick" TargetComp="NHHub" Delay="56.0">So we need to trigger a trap and then we wil see a breach in his security?</AddIRCMessage>

	<AddIRCMessage Author="Jenkins" TargetComp="NHHub" Delay="86.0">Okay, I've done with that file, from what I can see it is a dummy PC, that connected through Core.dll file in /sys folder</AddIRCMessage>

	<AddIRCMessage Author="Vortex" TargetComp="NHHub" Delay="97.0">Ok, analyze all processes on that dummy while I am having fun with that cocksucker</AddIRCMessage>
	<AddIRCMessage Author="Jenkins" TargetComp="NHHub" Delay="102.0">Yeah, delete Core.dll and that will trigger some kind of trap for you</AddIRCMessage>
